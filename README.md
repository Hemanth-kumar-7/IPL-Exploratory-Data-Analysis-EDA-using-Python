# 🏏 IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** dataset, including **ball-by-ball (`deliveries.csv`)** and **match-level (`matches.csv`)** data.  

The goal is to analyze **team strategies, player performances, and winning patterns** to derive **business insights** that can support decision-making in cricket analytics.

## 📂 Dataset Description
- **matches.csv** → Match-level data (winner, toss, venue, teams, etc.)  
- **deliveries.csv** → Ball-by-ball data (runs, wickets, bowler, batsman, dismissal, etc.)  

📊 **Total Records**  
- Matches → **1,095**  
- Deliveries → **260,920**
